                  Acidity problems affect up to 20% or more of adults on a regular 
                  basis.1,2 So even though you might think<br/> other people won’t understand what 
                  you’re going through, you’re not alone.

                  <p>
                  The most common problems associated with acidity are heartburn and acid 
                  reflux.1,2 Heartburn is that<br/> uncomfortable, burning feeling you have in the
                   centre of your chest, especially after eating a large meal.<br/><br/> Acid reflux
                    occurs when you taste regurgitated food or sour, bitter liquid at the
                     back of your mouth or<br/> throat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Acidity symptoms can be very unpleasant and can strike at the most 
                  inconvenient of times, but they can<br/> usually be managed quickly and simply.

                  What Is Acidity?
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                  To understand what acidity is, let’s revisit what we learned in 
                  science class about the digestive<br/> system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  When we swallow food or drink, it travels down a ‘pipe’ – called the 
                  esophagus – to our stomach. The<br/> base of the esophagus, where it joins
                   the stomach, has a band of muscle around it called a<br/> sphincter.1 This 
                   sphincter is closed tightly most of the time. It opens to allow food 
                   to enter the<br/> stomach, and then closes to stop the stomach contents 
                   from escaping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If the sphincter at the base of the esophagus is weakened or 
                  relaxes when it’s not meant to, gastric<br/> acid can rise up into
                   the esophagus and it’s this acid that causes the uncomfortable
                    symptom,<br/> heartburn
                  </p>

                  <h2>
                  Causes And Risks For Acidity Problems
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                  While a weak or abnormally relaxed oesophageal sphincter is the main 
                  cause of heartburn, we don’t<br/> always know why it becomes weakened or relaxed
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  When we eat a large meal, our sphincter muscles could stretch or become
                   weakened. Similarly, bending<br/> over or lying down may increase the pressure
                    on the sphincter, causing it to relax.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Other things seem to increase the risk of acidity problems without 
                  necessarily affecting the sphincter<br/> itself, so it’s a good idea to avoid them.

                          <p>
                          Yes, they do.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          We all have the occasional craving for certain foods that 
                          aren’t very good for us.<br/> But it’s important to remember to 
                          take everything in moderation. Fatty or fried foods,<br/> spicy 
                          foods, onions and garlic, tomatoes and<br/> tomato products, citrus 
                          fruits and chocolate may trigger acidity problems or make them worse.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Just like with food, it’s important to be wise about our choice 
                          of beverage – especially<br/> after a meal. Alcohol, coffee, tea and 
                          other softdrinks or energy drinks that contain<br/> caffeine may also
                           trigger acidity problems or make them worse.

                          <h3><strong>Do Certain Foods And Drinks Cause Acidity?</strong></h3>
                          <p>
                          Several of our lifestyle choices may be triggering heartburn.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Smoking may weaken the oesophageal sphincter. Besides being bad 
                          for our lungs,<br/> cigarettes bring about a host of other problems. 
                          This includes problems in the GI system.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Another factor that has a strong association with having
                           acidity problems is being<br/> overweight. Losing weight doesn’t 
                           only have to be for aesthetic purposes. It could<br/> also improve
                            your general health and wellbeing.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Also, many people find stress, or a lack of sleep 
                          can trigger their acidity symptoms or make them worse.

                          If you take any medicine on a regular basis, such as some
                           birth control pills or<br/> treatments for high blood pressure,
                            it may contribute to acidity problems. You should<br/> discuss

                  <p>Most of us have experienced heartburn – that burning sensation in the
                       chest – at<br/> some point in our lives. This is because it is the most
                        common symptom<br/> of an acidity problem.</p>
                  <p>Quite a lot of people suffer from heartburn at night, and around three
                       out of every<br/> four of these people say it disrupts their sleep.3 Acidity 
                       problems at night may be<br/> related to lifestyle factors – you can learn
                        more about that here.</p>
                  <p>Heartburn also commonly occurs during pregnancy. In fact, it is often seen 
                      as a<br/> completely normal part of being pregnant.4 Learn more about what you
                       can do to<br/> manage heartburn during your pregnancy journey here.</p>
                  <p>If you experience severe or very frequent heartburn (2 or more times a week)
                       and<br/> often have acid reflux, make an appointment with your doctor as this
                        may indicate a<br/> more serious form of acidity, called gastro-esophageal 
                        reflux disease (GERD).</p>
